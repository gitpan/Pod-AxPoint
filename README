NAME
    Pod::AxPoint - Generate AxPoint XML slideshow from POD source.

SYNOPSIS
     use Pod::AxPoint;
     my $ax = new Pod::AxPoint;
     print $ax->process($pod);

DESCRIPTION
    Pod::AxPoint converts POD input to AxPoint XML, which can be used to
    generate HTML Slideshows.

    The script pod2axpoint delivered with Pod::AxPoint provides a
    commandline frontend for the module.

    There is another script for this purpose on cpan,
    podslides-ax-magicpoint-0.01, but this creates a xslt transformation and
    doesn't support everything of AxPoint. That's why I wrote my own.

METHODS
  new()
    This creates a new Pod::AxPoint object.

  process($pod)
    This actually generates the AxPoint slideshow from the supplied POD
    string. Look at the POD section for details about the POD format.

    Returns the slideshow as single string containing the AxPoint XML code.

  syntax(%syntax)
    You may call this before calling process() to overwrite the internal
    syntax map for mapping from POD to XHTML.

    This is the default:

     %syntax = (
                  head1       => "title",
                  head2       => "title",
                  text        => "plain",
                  verbatim    => "source-code",
                  b           => "b",
                  i           => "i",
                  c           => "source-code",
                  f           => "i",
                  g           => "image",
                  list_number => "list",
                  list_bullet => "list",
                  list_text   => "list",
                  item_number => "point",
                  item_bullet => "point",
                  item_text   => "point",
                  table       => "table",
                  row         => "row",
                  cell        => "col",
                  );

    You are encouraged to keep this mapping as is.

POD
    Beside the known perlpod markup some exceptions has been made:

    *   Only the title =head1 is supported currently.

    *   Images can be included using the tag G<image.png>.

    *   Plain XML code can be included using the xml formatter, eg:

         =begin xml
 
         <title>Blah</title>
 
         =end xml

        This way you add the required metadata block to your slide.

DEPENDENCIES
    Pod::Tree perl module is required.

    AxPoint is required. I used the FreeBSD port:

     /usr/ports/print/axpoint (axpoint-1.50)

    Beside axpoint you need Pod::Tree for parsing POD.

    AxPoint itself has a lot of dependencies, here are all the (FreeBSD)
    packages were installed:

    If you're not on FreeBSD try cpan or install all the stuff manually -
    which is annoying.

    Last but not least: try FreeBSD.
