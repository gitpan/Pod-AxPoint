=head1 NAME

pod2axpoint

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 pod2axpoint inputfile.pod > outputfile.xml

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pod2axpoint> converts POD input to AxPoint XML, which
can be used to generate HTML Slideshows.

There is another script for this purpose on cpan,
L<podslides-ax-magicpoint-0.01>, but this creates a xslt
transformation and doesn't support everything of AxPoint.
That's why I wrote my own.

=head1 POD

Beside the known L<perlpod> markup some exceptions has been made:

=over

=item

Only the title B<=head1> is supported currently.

=item

Images can be included using the tag B<GE<lt>>image.pngB<E<gt>>.

=item

Plain XML code can be included using the B<xml> formatter, eg:

 =begin xml
 
 <title>Blah</title>
 
 =end xml

This way you add the required B<metadata> block to your slide.

=back


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

B<AxPoint> is required. I used the FreeBSD port:

 /usr/ports/print/axpoint (axpoint-1.50)

Beside axpoint you need L<Pod::Tree> for parsing POD.

B<AxPoint> itself has a lot of dependencies, here are all the
(FreeBSD) packages were installed:

 axpoint-1.50                   XML Based Presentations
 docbook-xml-4.2_1              XML version of the DocBook DTD

 fontconfig-2.3.2_6,1           An XML-based font configuration API for X Windows
 libxml2-2.6.27                 XML parser library for GNOME

 p5-XML-LibXSLT-1.59            Perl interface to the GNOME XSLT library
 p5-XML-NamespaceSupport-1.09_1 A simple generic namespace support class
 p5-XML-Parser-2.34_2           Perl extension interface to James Clark's XML parser, expat
 p5-XML-SAX-0.15                Simple API for XML
 p5-XML-SAX-Expat-0.38          Simple API for XML

 xmlcatmgr-2.2                  SGML and XML catalog manager

If you're not on FreeBSD try cpan or install all the
stuff manually - which is annoying.

Last but not least: try FreeBSD.
